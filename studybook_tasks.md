# Studybook Tasks

Below are suggested tasks for each chapter in the "Next Steps for Learning" studybook.

## 1. Study the base classes
- [ ] Read `src/Component.js`, focusing on event dispatch and variable handling.
- [ ] Examine `src/Control.js` to see how DOM nodes are managed.
- [ ] Review `src/Application.js` for application-level lifecycle and state management.
- [ ] Experiment by creating a simple component that logs events to the console.

## 2. Explore component definitions
- [ ] Browse the controls in `src/ui/` (e.g., `Button.js`, `List.js`).
- [ ] Identify how each control extends `Control` or another widget.
- [ ] Note any patterns in how events and CSS are applied.

## 3. Understand the Factory syntax
- [ ] Open `src/Factory.parse.js` and read the `parse()` function.
- [ ] Follow how component arrays are transformed into component trees.
- [ ] Create a small prototype using the `$([...])` syntax.

## 4. Look at the prototypes
- [ ] Explore `src/prototypes/` for prebuilt app scaffolds.
- [ ] Observe how prototypes define CSS and embed other prototypes.
- [ ] Try extending an existing prototype with your own component.

## 5. Consult the changelog
- [ ] Read `CHANGELOG.md` to understand recent updates.
- [ ] Note features or bug fixes that might affect your learning.
